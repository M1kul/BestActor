4. Net worth

The Best Actor is CONSISTENT

What makes a great actor truly the best? Hollywood appears to approach this question in two ways: super stars, the actors who continually star in the most popular and highest grossing movies, and tend to be paid very well for it, and the critical darlings, those actors who's work is critically acclaimed and are no strangers at industry awards shows. 

$tar Power
These are the household names -- the super stars. They anchor blockbuster movies and are paid some of the largest salaries in the business. An actor's star power ranking is determined by the domestic box office amount their movies make on average, their popularity (as determined by the total number of IMDb user votes on their movies), and of course their net worth. 


Critical Darlings
Actors are said to be "critical darlings" if they appear in films that are highly regarded or popular amongst film critics. These films are often recognized at awards shows and are usually highly rated by audiences. An actor's critical darling ranking is determined by their total number of awards (wins and nominations) and the average IMDb score* of their films.

The Pursuit of Perfection
Blockbuster stars can come and go and critical darlings can remain quiet and under-the-radar -- so what makes an actor the best? History tells us that it's consistency. The true greats have all had long, prolific, and diverse careers. They've starred in their fair share of mega hits along with being rewarded for their career defining performances.
