# Best Actor Assignment

>**Prompt:** Develop a PowerBI dashboard to demonstrate various methods for determining “Best Actor / Actress”.

What makes a great actor truly the best? Hollywood appears to approach this question in two ways: super stars, the actors who continually star in the most popular and highest grossing movies, and tend to be paid very well for it, and the critical darlings, those actors who's work is critically acclaimed and are no strangers at industry awards shows.

This analysis presents two rankings:
1. **Star Power** An actor's star power ranking is determined by the domestic box office amount their movies make on average, their popularity (as determined by the total number of IMDb user votes on their movies), and of course their net worth.

2. **Critical Darlings** An actor's critical darling ranking is determined by their total number of awards (wins and nominations) and the average IMDb score* of their films.

It also attempts to visualize an actor's consistency: how many movies have they starred in vs. how many nominations and awards have they received.
